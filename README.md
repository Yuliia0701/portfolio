## About me
Hi, my name is Yuliia! I am looking for a manual QA position. I do not have commercial experience, but I have finished QA courses, read a lot of documentation and technical literature, and worked with some testing tasks. I'm ready to learn a lot and want to become a valuable part of the team. I have an understanding of testing theory, SQL, HTML, and CSS. 
My English language level is B1.  Speaking about soft skills, I want to say that I have nearly 3 years of experience as an administrator, so I can communicate with different people for different goals, I know how to be a team player, and what time management is, multi-tasking, and how to prioritize goals. 


### My test tasks:
1. Test cases and checklist example: [test_cases_and_checklist](https://github.com/YuliiaHoltvianska/portfolio/blob/main/test_cases_and_checklist.pdf) (Google docs [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQ5oF4DB6E7HgASfa9gRECoMcWBoZIJGqW1ZaFKbBTk/edit?usp=sharing "link"))
2. Bug Reports example: [bug reports](https://github.com/YuliiaHoltvianska/portfolio/blob/main/bug_reports.pdf) (Google docs [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iC0DN99JQBzKvi7JG6m4ZlAq1Uebd9NVMe1ReH_F3nA/edit?usp=sharing))
